LunarPi: A Dual-Phase Lunar Rover Simulator

This is a lunar rover simulator, by using a raspberrypi 2 model B with a connected EOS-6D camera as the rover and my desktop pc as a basestation
I intend to manuever the rover (a moon rover in Kerbal Space Program) autonomosly by detecting features and navigating the lunar surface.
This process I will display capturing initial images, splitting them into small cells to train my AI model after I catagorize them by hand and duplicate them using minor techniques to increase the training data size. 

I have already proven that this technique will work with my initial training data, and plan on refining that data for further improvements before I create the navigation piece and attempt to run the full test.
